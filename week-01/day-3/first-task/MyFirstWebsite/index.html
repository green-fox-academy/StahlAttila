                <h3 id="subtitle">Soon to be a programmer</h3>
                <p>I'm 27 years old, living on my own and have a russian girlfriend who lives in Moscow. Finished university as a mechatronical engineer but couldn't find a job in it. After that i worked as a low current system technician (installing camera and alarm systems) then i quit and went to repair household coffemachines.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Programming was always in my head, but never had the courage to start to learn it untill now. I feel like that finally i found something that i can do for a long term and enjoy at the same time.</p>
